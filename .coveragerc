# Coverage configuration for unified-llm.
#
# Excluded provider adapter modules (OpenAI/Anthropic/Together) from the coverage gate
# because they are network-bound integration surfaces that would require API keys and live
# HTTP calls. Those are intentionally NOT run in CI.
#
# Unit tests focus on the stable, provider-agnostic logic (capability checks, request/response
# normalization, error mapping, and streaming interface).
